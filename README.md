### Color Picker Support 🎨

The extension uses the `provideDocumentColors` method to detect color values in RGB or HEX format. When you hover over any color value in the  `.ini`, `.inc`, and `.nek` file, a color preview is shown, and you can use the color picker to modify the color.

Both formats will be converted and presented in the editor as clickable color information, allowing for color selection and easy editing.

[Variables]
MyColor=255,0,0
MyHexColor=#FF5733
```
### Auto-Refresh on Save 🔄
